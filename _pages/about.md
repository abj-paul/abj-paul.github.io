👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the University of Dhaka.

🔬 My research interest lies in the niche field of Modularization of Neural Network based Web3 solutions. Additionally, I actively work for the progress of BNLP.

📚 I'm currently working towards my developing a multi-modal solution for Bangla Sign Language learning and detection.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## NLP Research  under Dr. Ahmedul Kabir, University of Dhaka
- Researched NLP from scratch level bayesian language model - normalization to word embedding, LLMs, Bangla Sign Language, Spelling Correction, Topic Modeling, Information Retrieval, stemmers, parts-of-speech tagging, and many more.
- As a research project lead, starting from reaching out to external organizations for resources, collaborations to recruiting new members, training and guiding them, leading the team towards the goal of the group and managing international relationships.
