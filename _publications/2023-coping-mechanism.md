collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-stemming-literature-review
excerpt: 'This study presents a pioneering investigation into the wide array of coping mechanisms employed by individuals in the year 2023, with a focus on data collected through the popular social media platform TikTok. Coping mechanisms are essential strategies that people adopt to navigate the challenges and stressors of everyday life, yet little research has been conducted on their comprehensive compilation across different backgrounds, countries, and experiences.

Using TikTok as a data collection tool allowed us to access a diverse and extensive pool of participants, representing various cultural, social, and demographic backgrounds. Our study collates coping mechanisms reported by users from different parts of the world, facilitating the identification of both universal and culture-specific strategies.

This research contributes to the existing literature by providing a holistic view of coping mechanisms without being limited to specific fields or populations. By analyzing the coping methods shared on TikTok, we reveal a comprehensive list of strategies employed by people from diverse walks of life. The findings of this study not only shed light on how individuals cope with challenges in the modern era but also offer insights into the evolving coping trends and the role of social media in disseminating coping strategies. Understanding these coping mechanisms can have implications for mental health professionals, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to provide support and resources to individuals facing different stressors and hardships.
