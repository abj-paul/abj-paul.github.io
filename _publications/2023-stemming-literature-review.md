title: "Stemming - The Evolution and Current State with a Focus on Bangla"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-stemming-literature-review
excerpt: 'Bangla is ranked as the 7th most widely spoken language across the world, with 300 million native speakers. The language is morphologically rich with diverse dialects and a long-standing literary tradition that developed over the course of thousands of years. However, the language is still considered low-resource in terms of digitization, primarily due to the scarcity of annotated, computer-readable datasets, and the limited support for resource building. Stemming is the act of reducing words to their common roots. Language tasks on low-resource, highly-inflectional languages such as Bangla can greatly benefit from stemming. As such, in this paper a detailed survey is conducted on stemming and different techniques employed for this purpose is explored. Specifically, the focus lies on Bangla stemming, and the paper endeavors to present an overview of the current state of research in this field.

 
The literature survey highlights important work on stemming in the English language, and then takes a closer look at literature for Bangla stemming. When compared to English, a significant gap in literature for Bangla stemming is noticed soon. Firstly, there is a noticeable discontinuity from previous work published for Bangla stemming. Results from the FIRE 2008-13 (Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation) have been largely forgotten, with future researchers starting again from scratch. Moreover, more recent work in the domain seldom provides accessible implementations that can lend itself to replication, or allow other researchers to build on them. A general flaw in the evaluation methodologies used in Bangla stemming research is highlighted. They were all evaluated either using simple accuracy measures, or using performance metrics from Information Retrieval tasks. Such metrics can be misleading due to the differences in significance of intrinsic properties like over-stemming and under-stemming errors.

In this work, a general research direction in Bangla NLP focusing on stemming is recommended, and gaps in existing literature are highlighted. It is hoped that this contribution can play an important role in shifting research focus, and help move us towards a more effective solution.'

In this work, a general research direction in Bangla NLP focusing on stemming is recommended, and gaps in existing literature are highlighted. It is hoped that this contribution can play an important role in shifting research focus, and help move us towards a more effective solution.
