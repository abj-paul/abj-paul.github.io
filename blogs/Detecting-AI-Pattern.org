#+DATE: <2024-08-24 শনি>

The proliferation of AI algorithms in web applications has made it increasingly difficult for users to understand the decision-making processes behind the services they interact with. This lack of transparency can lead to concerns about bias, privacy, and accountability.

*** Literature Review
Doosti et al, in their 2017 work, also provides a similar distribution of websites based on genre [3].

Shen, Meng, et al. proposed a literature review on use of AI in web 3.0 which identifies use cases of AI in all layers of Web 3.0. It can serve as a starting point for us to understand the use of AI in web applications [1]. Sajja et al wrote a book in 2012 which goes in-depth on AI in Web applications. While old, it can still provide us insights [2]. For example, we should pick a domain of websites and then, start finding AI patterns on them.

*** Detection Techniques - Lets think
We can find the following techniques for detecting AI usage in a website, using ChatGPT4o.
**** Statistical Analysis
- Pattern Recognition: Identifying unusual patterns or anomalies in data that suggest the presence of an AI algorithm.
- Correlation Analysis: Examining correlations between input and output data to determine if a complex relationship exists.
**** Machine Learning Model Fingerprinting
- Model Architecture: Analyzing the underlying architecture of a machine learning model to identify specific algorithms.
- Model Parameters: Examining the parameters and weights used in a model to distinguish it from other types.
**** API Analysis
- API Calls: Monitoring API calls made by a web application to identify cloud-based AI services.
- API Documentation: Analyzing API documentation to determine if it describes AI-related functionalities.

**** Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Analysis: Analyzing textual content within a web application to identify keywords or phrases associated with AI.
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in text to gauge the level of AI involvement.
**** Behavior Analysis
- User Interactions: Observing user interactions with a web application to identify patterns that suggest AI-driven personalization.
- Dynamic Content: Analyzing the dynamic nature of content to determine if it is being generated or curated by AI.

*** Data Collection
We pick ~Beauty~ as our target genre. Let us now list some websites on Beauty.

AI usage in Beauty websites include:
1. Personalized Recommendations: AI algorithms analyze user preferences and behaviors to recommend skincare products, makeup items, or beauty routines tailored to individual needs.
2. Virtual Try-ons: AI-powered augmented reality (AR) allows users to virtually try on makeup or hairstyles using their device’s camera.
3. Image recognition: AI analyzes user photos to provide personalized beauty advice, such as identifying skin issues or suggesting suitable products.
4. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: AI chatbots offer personalized beauty tips, answer product-related questions, and assist with customer service.
5. Trend Analysis: AI tracks and analyzes beauty trends and customer feedback to help brands adapt their product offerings and marketing strategies.

   We now need to annotate the websites to understand the places where AI is actually used. For that, we need to use the sites.
