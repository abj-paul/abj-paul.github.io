** Formal Method is interesting

* Life
** What you give is what you receive
   - Be generous with your time, kindness, and resources. The more you give, the more you'll receive in return.

** Be authentic
   - Stay true to yourself and your values. Don't compromise your integrity for the sake of others' approval.
