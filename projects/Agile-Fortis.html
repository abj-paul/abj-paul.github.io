<h2 id="update-optimization-function-to-address-cost-concerns">Update Optimization function to address cost concerns</h2>
<p>I am trying to change codebase of Fortis - a research paper made by a PhD student in CMU. So I need to run that codebase for that, firstly.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-not-found">Dependency not found!</h3>
<p>These dependencies are not available in maven repository. So they must be available as jar files online. But I could not find any such jar files! And I checked .gitignore file of the <a href="https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-core">fortis-core</a> repository and it excluded <code>bin</code> folder that includes the jar files. <img src="../data/fortis-depedency-issue.png" /></p>
<p>Possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is available somewhere online and I cannot find it, yet.</li>
<li>It is an internal file of cmu.soda</li>
<li>Remove those dependencies and see what happens: Many other issues are still there, sigh</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="common-package-not-found">common package not found!</h3>
<p>As you can see in the list of packages, there is no <code>common</code> package. I checked last 30 commits randomly and did not find this folder in ANY of the commits! Its also not in .gitignore <img src="../data/common folder not found.png" /></p>
<p>Possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>My friend Radium found this <a href="https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-api.git">fortis-api</a> repository. It has THE common package! It worked!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="use-chatgpt-to-generate-costs">Use ChatGPT to generate costs</h2>
<p>The goal is to generate costs and use that to generate graphs. Then we will inspect how effective those generations are.</p>
<p>The input should be:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>  Controllable states are which that machine can control. And obserables are which that machine can observe. Give a list of states, you will return me the controllableMap and obseravbleMap. Assign a cost between 0-4 to them. Keep sum of cost within total_cost.

Example input:
 states: [&quot;eo.enter&quot;, &quot;eo.exit&quot;, &quot;v.enter&quot;, &quot;v.exit&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, &quot;vote&quot;, &quot;back&quot;, &quot;back&quot;, &quot;confirm&quot;]
description: It is a voting system. In the environment, both EO and voter can enter anytime. The individual gives password, selects a vote and confirms. He can go back anytime. It is crucial that the person who entered the password is the person who confirms the vote.
total_cost: 30


Example output:
    &quot;controllableMap&quot;: {
  &quot;1&quot;: [
      &quot;back&quot;,
      &quot;confirm&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;,
      &quot;select&quot;,
      &quot;vote&quot;
  ],
  &quot;3&quot;: [
      &quot;eo.enter&quot;,
      &quot;eo.exit&quot;,
      &quot;v.enter&quot;,
      &quot;v.exit&quot;
  ]
  },
  &quot;observableMap&quot;: {
  &quot;0&quot;: [
      &quot;back&quot;,
      &quot;confirm&quot;,
      &quot;password&quot;,
      &quot;select&quot;,
      &quot;vote&quot;
  ],
  &quot;2&quot;: [
      &quot;eo.enter&quot;,
      &quot;eo.exit&quot;,
      &quot;v.enter&quot;,
      &quot;v.exit&quot;
  ]
  }

<p>Now let us consutrct a dataset.</p>
