** Update Optimization function to address cost concerns
I am trying to change codebase of Fortis - a research paper made by a PhD student in CMU. So I need to run that codebase for that, firstly.

*** Dependency not found!
These dependencies are not available in maven repository. So they must be available as jar files online. But I could not find any such jar files! And I checked .gitignore file of the [[https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-core][fortis-core]] repository and it excluded ~bin~ folder that includes the jar files.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/fortis-depedency-issue.png]]

Possible reasons:
1. It is available somewhere online and I cannot find it, yet.
2. It is an internal file of cmu.soda
3. Remove those dependencies and see what happens: Many other issues are still there, sigh

*** common package not found!
As you can see in the list of packages, there is no ~common~ package. I checked last 30 commits randomly and did not find this folder in ANY of the commits! Its also not in .gitignore
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/common folder not found.png]]

Possible solutions:
1. My friend Radium found this [[https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-api.git][fortis-api]] repository. It has THE common package! It worked!
2. And here is [[https://github.com/SteveZhangBit/LTL-Learning][LTL Learning]] repository.
3. And here is [[https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib?tab=readme-ov-file][automatalib-core]] repository. It did not work so we [[https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/net.automatalib/automata-core][found this]].
4. Also, automatalib-common may also be needed.


Their pom file is also incomplete! We had to manually add 1 dependency, but it still shows error. The eternally long list of errors can be found [[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/errors][here]]

** Use ChatGPT to generate costs
The goal is to generate costs and use that to generate graphs. Then we will inspect how effective those generations are. 

The input and prompts can be found in the dataset.

Now let us consutrct a dataset.
| Dataset   | Size      | Result                     | ChatGPT      |
|-----------+-----------+----------------------------+--------------|
| [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-P9ouC9n9LPoleihJi20zfxn_1ZUm6D0snTOn9kCtM/edit?usp=sharing][Prompt_v1]] | 5 systems | Failed to find a solution. | [[https://chatgpt.com/share/66ea5931-daf0-8007-8250-eb7db4f186cd][chatGPT logs]] |
|           |           |                            |              |

We skip total_cost for now. It makes the process complex. Now we need to run Fortis to understand how good the cost assignments are.
