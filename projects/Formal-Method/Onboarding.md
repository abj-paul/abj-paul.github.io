# Environment setup

First of all we need to make sure you have access to internal chats and system. There is a list below showing required steps to do accordingly.

- [ ] Setup MEGA
- [ ] Setup Obsidian
- [ ] Setup GitHub account
- [ ] Setup VS Code
- [ ] Learn `git` and its commands

# Propositional logic

First things first. We need to form a strong foundation to know what we do and what we work with. The first building block we need to trim and polish is **Logic**. Logical expressions appear everywhere in computer programs but for us it is crucial to have a strong understanding of logical basics as well as more advanced topic (further on). The reason of that is because we formal methods that are essentially based on certain logics, and the same assertion is true for proof assistants.

There is a list of 3 books that is suggested to work through. They provide a substantial explanation of the propositional logic (predicate calculus) and the first-order logic.

How to use this list below:
1. go one by one: 1 -> 2 -> 3
2. inside each point there are sub-blocks, follow them in respect of their order
3. follow the additional instruction if they appear 😁

> [!tip] Do not rush or skim or roam through. The goal is to understand and memorize and be ready to use and speculate on a topic.

## Challenges
1. [[Personal/Paul/Logic in computer science.pdf|Logic in computer science]]
	- [ ] Your target pages are 1 - 68
		- Your goal is to read and understand propositional logic fundamentals. So, go through the suggested pages, sections 1.1 - 1.5 (*the section 1.6 we are currently not interested in, but you can skim it for the curiosity*)
			- [ ] 1.1 Declarative sentences
			- [ ] 1.2 Natural deduction
			- [ ] 1.3 Propositional logic as a formal language
			- [ ] 1.4 Semantics of propositional logic
			- [ ] 1.5 Normal forms
	- [ ] Exercises begin from the page 78
		- There are exercises dedicated to each paragraph (`1.1 - 1.1`), so, we need to complete all these exercises accordingly.
		- Solutions for each exercise should be formed as follows:
			- Written in #rust 🦀
			- Each exercise should be presented as a new branch -> new PR into the repository. (If you do not have a repository inside the Inferara organization, please create one for yourself or ask Georgii to create it for you). If you need an inspiration about a project structure you can take a look at the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) repository, and we can discuss it in DM.
			- Once a PR is approved, it can be merged to the repository.
				- [ ] 1.1 Declarative sentences
				- [ ] 1.2 Natural deduction
				- [ ] 1.3 Propositional logic as a formal language
				- [ ] 1.4 Semantics of propositional logic
				- [ ] 1.5 Normal forms
		- You can **optionally** approach these exercises with hand-written solutions with pen and paper.
	- [ ] Write a conspectus.
		- It is very important to memorize new knowledge. You can make notes in a way you prefer it, whereas it is a paper notebook, notability or similar program, your personal obsidian directory here, it is up to you.
		- Prepare an essay, containing $KaTeX$ with the important notes and explanations you found most important to pay attention at. We will review it together and share it on our resources.
