** Literature Review
You can find the [[https://www.overleaf.com/project/6633a3c24c44378a593d48e3][shared overleaf for literature review here.]]
*** Computational Analysis
**** Word Embedding
Fonseca et al explored caste discrimination in indian liteature. They first trained a word2vec model using the newspaper article and then they mapped a correlation graph with the word "Caste" based on cosine similarity. After that, they estimated relative frequence of the word caste in easy article by summing the occurence of the words in each article. They did not sum 1 for each occurence, rather the cosine similarity score. After that, they picked the top 7\% articles and performed LDA on them [1].
**** TODO Word Count
It counted the keywords against a demography as part of their detailed sociological analysis on the view of that demography in news.
*** Sociological Analysis
**** Perspective: Why not talk about our sufferings?
Saleem & Ramasubramanian found that Muslim American students who viewed negative media representations of their religious ingroup, relative to a control video, were less likely to desire acceptance by other Americans and more likely to avoid interactions with majority members. Such representation discrimination incease inter-group distance [3].
Haraldsson showcased the way media discrimination hinders progress towards putting femininity on an equal footing with masculinity in the political domain in her theisis [4].
Ittefaq et al. revealed that sanitary workers in Pakistan believe that they do not have any representation in Pakistan’s mainstream media to voice their issues. Moreover, they have serious reservations about their polemic social representation and voice concerns regarding the media that often amplify such depictions [5]. 
**** Perspective: Racist Stereotypical Representation
In this amazing work, Galdi et al showed through social experiments how stereotypical gay men representation increases social bias about them. Heterosexual Italian men (N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants’ prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character [6].
**** Perpective: Under-representation hurts
Balasubramaniam et al shows how representation discrimination affects the dalit community. They argue that under-representation of Dalits of Dalits leads to news exclusion related to dalits [2].
*** Journalism
**** Finding news genre
AP News Taxonomy is a classification system for English-language news content that includes standardized subjects, geographic locations, people, organizations and publicly traded companies. This search- and SEO-friendly taxonomy is designed to support digital news products [7]. Their classifications are globally recognized and utilized by numerous media outlets.

1. Business
2. Climate and environment
3. Education
4. Entertainment
5. General news
   - U.S. news
   - World news
   - Washington news
6. Health
7. Lifestyle
8. Media
9. Obituaries
10. Oddities
11. Politics
12. Race and ethnicity
13. Religion
14. Science
15. Sports
16. Technology

    But these genres don't necessarily reflect in our culture. For example, Washington news is not part of our general news, neither is race-ethnicity a significant topic in our news. So we now go through Bangladesh press media to list their genres.

    | Newspaper           | genre                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
    | Prothom Alo         | Politics, Crime, International, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Jobs, Lifestyle, ~Local news, Health, Environmental Concern~, Education, Technology, Gadgets, Religion, Science, Comic                                                                                                           |
    | The daily Star      | Sports, Business, Entertainment, Life&Living, Youth, Tech&Startup, Environment, Education, Career, Fashion & Beauty, Food & Recipes, Health & Fitness, Lifehacks, Relationships & Family, Travel, TV & Film, Music, Theatre & Arts, Satire, Featured, Heritage, GADGETS, GAMING, GUIDES, STARTUPS |
    | Bangladesh Protidin | Local news, Lifestyle, Business, Religion, International, Sports, National news, Campus, Corporate corner, health, Tech world, politics, Chitaggong, Science, Facebook corner, Foreign bangladeshi, Oddities |

We combine these genres and find the following genres. Our detailed combining procedure can be found in this [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YKAvQ_nCDkW7_27Yi7C7rR9yb8BU7ontKYhm1N2RE_4/edit?usp=sharing][google sheets file.]]

#+begin_src text
  Politics, Crime, International, Business & Economics, Sports, Entertainment, Jobs, Lifestyle, Health, Environment, Local news, Education, Technology, Religion, Science
#+end_src

Additionally, we consider the news genre ~Protests and Social Movements, Human rights~ since that is what we wish to investigate.

We finally match these 17 topics with our earlier trial-and-error news topics and find two mismatch (natural disaster, govt action). We strongly feel that ~govt action~ should be a field instead of human rights or Local news.

Ross, Karen, et al. shows an interesting approach. It first discoveres the news genre distributon of newspaper and then compares it with female population [8].

**** Defining Selected 17 News Genre
I have taken the definitions from ChatGPT. But maybe, we need to take it from some journal. Well, we will need it later on for ChatGPT based news classfication so we won't need such exact definition now.

1. Politics: Covers political news, including national and regional politics, elections, government policies, and political analysis.
2. Crime: Reports on criminal activities, law enforcement, legal proceedings, and related issues.
3. Economy and Business: Focuses on economic policies, market trends, business developments, and financial news.
4. Sports: News related to sports, including coverage of local and international sports events, player profiles, and analyses.
5. International Affairs: Reports on global events and how they impact Bangladesh, including international politics, conflicts, and diplomatic relations.

17. Science: Discusses scientific discovery, science for children and oddities.

**** Finding usual perspective from which newspaper articles are analyzed
For the longest time, newspaper articles have been analyzed manually by researchers. This has restricted the size of data they can process. So in this work, we identify the most famous perspectives from which newspaper articles are analyzed to detect discrimination.

1. Presence of ethnography in major news area [9]
2. Straight, Investigative, Commentary
3. Source of news information: subject, spokeperson, expert or commentator, personal experience, popular opinion, eye witness [9]. or spokeperson, expert, victim [10].

** Experiment
We conduct numerous experiments since it is a sensitive topic to make claims on. The experiments are done over a long period of time so we follow the following meta data to store their results.

| Experiment details           |
|------------------------------|
| Experiment name              |
| Date                         |
| Objective                    |
| Result                       |
| Future Work                  |
| Artifacts (code, input data) |

Observe that, we do not stoe the output of the experiment because once can find that simply by running the code with that input data.
Also, you can find our codebase [[https://github.com/abj-paul/Representation-Discrimination-of-Ethnic-People-in-Bangladesh/tree/main][in this github repository.]]
*** Task - Keyword Based Data Collection
This our curated dataset]] of ethnic word-contained articles from [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ebiswas/bangla-largest-newspaper-dataset][ebD- Bangla newspaper dataset.]] We have curated ethnic people related dataset using simply keyword based extraction. We considered the following keywords to filter out the articles.

*** TODO Failed Attempts
Word embedding model training on the whole dataset. This was a MAJOR blockage in our earlier work.

Clearly, stemming is needed here. We used [[https://github.com/Foysal87/sbnltk/blob/main/docs/Stemmer.md][SBNLTK]] Stemmer here because this project is the largest BNLP library and the developer seems pretty active. After stemming, we got the following topics.

*** Experiment - Supervised Topic Modeling to find best Alpha score
We modeled coherence score against different alpha values of LDA model. For 10187 dataset,
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/alpha_value_10187.png]]
We had the highest coherence score for alpha value around 73. So we get our final topic list from an LDA with coherence score = 0.7394. The topic list is below.

*** Experiment - Semi Supervised Topic Modeling on Ethnic, nonethnic
<2024-07-28 রবি>
Objective: Since supervised topic modeling gave bad topics, let us try corex.

We collected 5342 ethnic articles from (4.4M->10132) news articles. We then used semi-supervised CoRex topic modeling. We used the following words as anchors.
#+begin_src python
  anchors = [["ক্রীড়া", "রুপা", "স্বর্ণপদক",  "ব্রোঞ্জপদক"], ["নির্বাচন","প্রার্থী", "চেয়ারম্যান"], ["পর্যটক"], ["উদযাপন", "নবান্ন", "উৎসব"], ["বিদ্রোহ", "কল্পনা"], ["মামলা"] , ["সরকার", "লুটপাট", "দুর্নীতি", "প্রশিক্ষণ"], [ "সেতু", "সংস্কার", "সংকট", "পানি"], ["বাংলাদেশ", "বিমানবাহিনী", "অফিসার", "ক্যাডেট"] ]
#+end_src

Later, we also collected exactly 5342 nonethnic articles for an equal comparison. The results are in result section below.
**** Result
The topic coherence (tc) score is 137.05506096485365. We also required 50 topics due to the sheer size of dataset. For doc_prob > 20.0, we found the following distribution of docs for 50 topics, summarized under 15 genre using ChatGPT-4o and manual supervision.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/ethnic_corex_5132_distribution.png]]

For 5342 nonethnic articles, the topic coherence score and individual doc_prob score came out very low. So for the SAME doc_prob > 20.0, we only got 1891 articles that are

[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/nonethnic_corex_5132_distribution.png]]

**** Issues
- [ ] why is tourism genre empty?
- [X] CoRex does NOT automatically assign docs to topics. It's a problem. So we had to do thresholding.

*** Task - Mass Annotation of 5342 Ethnic Articles
<2024-08-09 শুক্র>
Objective: Quality data is necessary so we need to annotate to clean the data. Its also because of our definition of ~exact article~.

I first did an exploratory analysis of the articles. When annotating, we paid close attention to why we are annotating the data as such by noting down the reason. It increased our understanding of the underlying data. We used the following interface for this stage of annotation and ended up annotating around [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LYRQDj_N2fMkipXaQIvm4N1Dzfr_cAZN/view?usp=drive_link][100 data.]]

[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/Exploratory annotation.png]]


If we remember, we only did keyword based extraction to collect ethnic article dataset. To make it cleaner, we decided to annotate them manually and identify the exact articles which are about ethnic people. But annotating 5000+ articles is a mammoth undertaking. So we considerd keybinding - user will just see the article and press E/N to annotate ethnic, nonethnic. Usage of keybinding increase annotation speed significantly. But still, we annotated around 150 nonethnic articles.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/annotating-ethnic-article_fast.png]]

We also made one tool for easy understanding of ~Topics in Topic modeling~ by inspecting the documents in each topic.

**** Result
- Annotated 100 data with "why they are ethnic article or why not".
- Fast annotated 150 data with E or N.
- Simple annotation tool development
- Data understanding

**** Issues
- [ ] Finding literature on exact definition and loose definition
- [ ] Lets say, we annotate 5000 data. But there is no way to find another annotator to annotate 5000 data.
- [ ] I should use the topic document annotation tool more frequently

*** Experiment - Ethnic 100 articles with Gemini-1.5 Flash
<2024-08-14 বুধ>
Objective: Seeing if gemini-1.5 flash free tier can be used for annotation

A major part of our experiment is genre classification. We have identified the following 15 genres: Crime, Politics, Natual Disaster, Sciene & Environment, Government actions, Business & Economy, International Affairs, Education, Health, Sports, Protests, Culture, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Discourse. Additionally, we also wanna find if the description is Straight, Investigation, Commentary.

Human are biased at annotating things they relate to. According to a journalist on his comment about LLM for news analysis, he said and I quote, "LLMs are the least biased journalist". So even without rigourous validation, we went with experimenting with Gemini-1.5 for news genre and news style annotation.

**** Result
We picked 100 articles from our 5132 ethnic news articles (which we extracted using keywords) and as we can see, most articles are on crime and discourse.

[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/genre_frequency_ethnic5132_100.png]]

We tried to annotate non-ethnic articles as well but i think we soon ran out of free usage limit.
**** Issues
- [X] We observed that the keyword "Rakhain" resulted in the inclusion of Rohingya issue related articles. So we further cleaned our 5132 ethnic articles and ended up with around [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PijubT8OPxtakV07lqGuIGx8wvm8CkoR/view?usp=drive_link][4893 articles]].
- [ ] We need to scale gemini based annotation. We need to understand what is the free tier limit and then, use multiple accounts to do it.
- [ ] We need to finalize on our few shot prompt instruction.

*** Experiment - Nonethnic 100k articles with Corex
<2024-08-15 বৃহঃ>
Objective: Seeing if using more articles gives us a more complete distribution of usual news genre.

We collected 100k nonethnic articles from 4.4M news articles. We then used semi-supervised CoRex topic modeling. We used the following words as anchors.
#+begin_src python
  anchors = [["ক্রীড়া", "রুপা", "স্বর্ণপদক",  "ব্রোঞ্জপদক"], ["নির্বাচন","প্রার্থী", "চেয়ারম্যান"], ["পর্যটক"], ["উদযাপন", "নবান্ন", "উৎসব"], ["বিদ্রোহ", "কল্পনা"], ["মামলা"] , ["সরকার", "লুটপাট", "দুর্নীতি", "প্রশিক্ষণ"], [ "সেতু", "সংস্কার", "সংকট", "পানি"], ["বাংলাদেশ", "বিমানবাহিনী", "অফিসার", "ক্যাডেট"] ]
#+end_src
**** Result
The topic coherence (tc) score is 52.49676727298845. We also required 50 topics due to the sheer size of dataset. For doc_prob > 20.0, we found the following distribution of docs for 50 topics, summarized under 15 genre using ChatGPT-4o and manual supervision.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/nonethnic_news_corex_100k_genres.png]]

**** Issues
- [X] Increased max_vocab_size to 50k.
- [ ] Is topic coherence score low? If yes, why.
- [ ] The 15 genres we selected are not all-encompassing. Need to find some literature on it. Specially the ~discourse~ genre. It is as if every news is a discourse.
- [ ] Need to pick better ~Anchor words~ for each of the 15 genre.

*** Experiment - Ethnic (4893) with Corex 
~Objective:~ Getting a final result on ethnic people related articles' topic distribution.

Since we are using CoRex, anchor words selection is an important phase. So we first select generic words as anchor words and then select ethnicity specific ethnic words. We will see what performance difference there is. Note: We did not do it. Because it would add bias to the process. For such a critical topic, we want to do it as unbiased as possible.

Note that, we increased threshold to ~25.0~ here since doc_prob was higher for overall distribution.
**** Result
We achieved a topic correlation score of ~143.63331714565578~. Following is our result for CoRex Semi-Supervisd topic modeling on 4893 ethnic data.

*** Experiment - Bangla news distribution (100k) with Corex
~Objective:~ Getting a final result on usual news topic distribution in Bangla.

**** Result
Following is our result for CoRex Semi-Supervisd topic modeling on 100k sample articles from our original 4.4M articles. We achieved a topic correlation score of ~55.4916729561928~.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/nonethnic_corex_100k_final.png]]
We validate our news genre distribution against work by Ross, Karen, et al. Their news genre distribution strongly correlates with our findings, except Sports genre [8]. BD culture have strong feelings regarding sports, speciall football and cricket. So it explains away our distriution.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/news-category-by-medium.png]]

**** Issue
- [ ] A lot of articles were discarded later on (From 100k documents, only 33k documents had doc_prob > 25.0. After removing garbage topics, the number of final documents in consideration decreased even further. Ig those are good data? Or is it a flaw? In fact, among 50 topics, 22 topics were garbage.

   #+begin_src text
     You are a Bangla news article analyzer. I will give you a news article and you will say which genre(s) it belongs to. The genres are:  Politics, Crime, International Affairs,  Business & Economy,  Sports,  Culture & Entertainment,  Jobs,  Lifestyle,  Health,  Environment,  Local news,  Education,  Technology,  Religion,  Science,  Protests and Social Movements, Govt Actions.  Additionally, you will also say if the description is Straight, Investigation, Commentary. Identify the perspective of any ethnic person mentioned in the article, choosing from the following categories: Subject, Spokesperson, Expert or Commentator, Personal Experience, Popular Opinion, Eyewitness. Return me just a json of {\"genre\": GENRE, \"description_style\": STYLE, \"perspective\": PERSPECTIVE}. Note that, each news will have at most 3 genres, ideally 1.
   #+end_src

**** Result
Failed! Because of quota limit. Gemini would stop after processing 15 articles. (IDK why).
**** Issues
- [ ] Should i get one genre or multiple genre?
- [ ] Try chatGPT and Gemini to compare which is better.

*** Experiment - H0: There is no difference in size between ethnic and normal articles.
Atuel, Hazel et al provided a work very similar to ours in their work on ~majority and minority representation~ [11]. They showed topic distribution, ethnic article count and ethnic article size as a means to understand media representation. So we now try to find prove the hypothesis.

| Group     | Total Articles |            Average |
|-----------+----------------+--------------------|
| Ethnic    | 4893           | 440.65563049254035 |
| Nonethnic | 100k           | 124.93548193554193 |

Using Welch's t-test, p-value = 1.840763388749358e-195. For level of significance 0.05, we reject the H0.

We also do some wordclouds here.
For ~remove_stopword~ phase, we used a dictionary of stop_words, along with ~len(word)>3~.
[[file:~/abj-paul.github.io/data/word_cloud_threshold_3.png]]

** Survey
*** Literature
Atuel, Hazel et al first proves representation discrimination and then, tries to provide an explanation for it using sociological literature [11].
Georgiou, Myria et al first performs interviews and then summarizes their findings by quoting what particiapnts have said about certain topics [12]. However, they do support those participants' claims empirically.

Bryant et al discussed the effects of media under-representation on minority groups. The findings indicate that televised portrayals of racial/ ethnic minorities influence majority group members’ real-world perceptions about minority groups as well as minority group members’ evaluations of self. The factors facilitating this learning process (perception) include frequency of television exposure, characteristics of the content/message, realism of the portrayal, similarity to the model, identification with the model, and level of individual cognitive ability (Bandura, 1986; Potter, 1986). Taken together, these variables provide one framework for understanding the extent to which the content and number of portrayals of minorities on television may result in judgment formation [13].
*** CDA
It focuses on linguistic devices or speech acts and how they serve powerful social groups to fulfill their interest

Van Dijk’S ideological square allows subtle analysis to express various ideological stances. It includes:
- Emphasise positive things about Us
- Emphasise negative things about Them
- De-emphasise negative things about Us
- De-emphasise positive things about Them

Behnam and Mahmoudy (2013) discovered the political ideology in Iran’s nuclear report through discourse structure. In determining the ideological structures, the presupposition concept was employed leading to a specific ideological structure. This can be depicted through the phrase: “Iran has not provided requested information…” (Kerr 2009, p.2). The phrase denotes a negative belief in Iran. Besides, another preference in which ideology can be determined is through repetitive words in the report such as undeclared, uncertainties, inconsistencies, and contamination. These words depict a destructive image for the country such as: a) Iran is trying to conceal information from the world view, and b) Iran is inconsistent in its nuclear program. 

Ramanathan et al provided many more examples of CDA in their paper on "Applications of CDA" where researchers manually inspect articles to find bias towards certain idelogical stance [14].

When applied to the study of ethnic minorities, CDA often focuses on how these groups are represented in the media, politics, and public discourse. Key questions might include:

1. How are ethnic minorities depicted in news stories? Are they portrayed in a negative or stereotypical manner? Are they underrepresented or misrepresented?
2. What language is used to describe ethnic minorities? Are certain words or phrases consistently used to marginalize or otherize these groups?
3. What ideologies are at play? How does the discourse reflect broader societal attitudes towards ethnic minorities? Does it challenge or reinforce existing power structures?

I think we can't use it because frankly, analyzing articles manually is time-consuming and will include my bias.

*** Questions
We ask the following questions to ethnic people. Our goal is understanding ~News media Under-Representations and its Impact on the Lives of Indigenous people~.

~Survey/Interview Topic: "Under-Representation in News Media and Its Impact on the Lives of Indigenous People in Bangladesh"~

This survey/interview aims to understand the effects of under-representation in news media on the lives, identity, and societal perceptions of Indigenous people in Bangladesh.

1. **Demographic Information:**
   - What is your ethnicity?
   - What is your age?
   - What is your gender?
   - Where do you reside in Bangladesh?
   - What is your occupation or role within your community?

2. **Media Consumption Habits:**
   - How often do you consume news media (daily, weekly, rarely)?
   - What types of news media do you typically follow (TV, newspapers, online news, social media)?
   - How important is news media in your daily life?

3. **Perception of Media Representation:**
   - How often do you see news stories featuring your ethnic group in Bangladeshi media?
   - Do you feel that your community is under-represented in the news media? Why or why not?
   - When your community is represented in the news, what is the typical context (e.g., cultural events, conflicts, political issues)?

4. **Impact of Under-Representation:**
   - How does the lack of representation in news media affect your sense of identity and belonging?
   - Have you noticed any social or cultural impacts in your community due to under-representation in the news?
   - Do you think under-representation affects how other communities in Bangladesh view your ethnic group? If so, how?

5. **Cultural Impact:**
   - Does the under-representation of your community in news media contribute to the loss or marginalization of your cultural practices?
   - How does the media’s focus (or lack thereof) on your community affect the younger generation's understanding of their heritage?

6. **Media and Stereotyping:**
   - Do you think that the limited representation your community receives in the media reinforces stereotypes? If yes, what kind of stereotypes?
   - Have you or your community members experienced any negative consequences (e.g., discrimination, misunderstanding) due to these stereotypes?

7. **Community Responses and Actions:**
   - Has your community taken any steps to address the issue of under-representation in the news media?
   - Are there any media initiatives within your community to improve visibility? If so, can you describe them?

8. **Recommendations for News Media:**
   - What changes would you like to see in how the news media covers stories related to Indigenous people?
   - How can news media contribute to better representation and understanding of Indigenous communities in Bangladesh?
   - Do you think that involving Indigenous voices in the news production process would lead to better representation? How?

9. **Final Thoughts:**
   - Is there anything else you would like to share about the impact of news media on your community?
   - What message would you like to send to news organizations about the importance of representing Indigenous people fairly and accurately?
